Stock Trading Model with API KEY (API KEY must be provided)

Hi! This is my first project. Basically, I want to see the graph of the stock prices of any company with tables shown using the Open, Close, High, and Low values. Since there are lot of stock trading scripts out there. Knowing that Yahoo/Google API are not publicly available, I am using Alphavantage's API. It's free. Check it out. 

You must have your own API key.
